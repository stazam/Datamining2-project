text = "The focus of this tutorial is to learn how to make word clouds that donâ€™t suck on a visual and content-based level. There are tons a free tools online for non-programmers to make word clouds, but visualizing your data within your python pipeline as you iterate parameters during an NLP project can be a powerful way to evaluate the results of your decisions, and present your process to non-technical stakeholders. Having a visual design background, I find the out-of-the-box word cloud package to be sort-of horrendous, so I will offer a few tweaks that will make your word clouds not suck."
