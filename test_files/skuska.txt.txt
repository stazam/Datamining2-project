The breathtaking winter wonderland of the Nordic countries is like no other place on Earth. Stunning scenery and a white Christmas are already guaranteed, but throw in exploring ice caves, snowmobile tours, whale spotting and tracking down the real Santa, and you’ve suddenly got the adventure holiday of a lifetime on your hands.

And great news for hunters of the aurora borealis is that this winter there are spectacular new ways to do it. So if you can embrace the cold, we have gathered together the best expeditions, including a night flight in a hot-air balloon in Sweden, or stargazing in the company of an astronomer from The Sky At Night in Iceland. Unfortunately you can’t guarantee an aurora sighting, but if they don’t show up on this 15-day expedition up the Norwegian coast to North Cape, travel firm Hurtigruten will give you another seven-day trip free of charge.

The expedition starts and ends in Dover, so you avoid airport hassle. And there are a number of included outings, such as a ride on Bergen’s funicular, a visit to one of the Lofoten islands where fishing villages are found in magnificent fjords, and a coach tour of the dramatic scenery of Senja.

The journey culminates with a visit to North Cape, with its dramatic plateau high above the Arctic Ocean.  Take spotting the Northern Lights to new heights in Sweden by going up in a tethered hot-air balloon for unobstructed views of this stunning natural phenomenon. Or enjoy a morning ride, floating above the frozen lakes and forests of Rane River Valley. Flights start in February and can be booked by guests staying in one of four cosy tents at the Aurora Safari Camp, which is also a good base to spot moose, red fox and reindeer. The use of fat bikes (mountain bikes with wide tyres), Nordic skis and snowshoes is included, with snowmobiling, dog-sledding and air-ballooning as optional extras.
